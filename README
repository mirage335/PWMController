__Usage__
Generic switching power supply block, with emphasis on low EMI. Capable of self-bootstrapping, may be used to generate control voltages for MOSFETS, IGBTs, and similar devices. In some situations, particularly with a linear regulator, may be directly suitable as a generic power supply.

Top-level schematic and PCB layout form a dedicated PCB module, which may be surface-mount soldered directly to the pads defined in the subcircuit. Subcircuit may be integrated into other systems, where individual components or entire module may be soldered in place.

__Design__
Spread-spectrum low-frequency (~5kHz default) switching power supply regulator. Modulation has been carefully characterized to minimize narrowband interference. Duty cycle is limited to permit flyback converter use.

USA companies provide all parts in these schematics.
